# Zero-framework

Rather then following a tutorial which you would create a project based on another creators workflow and development style, I wanted to be able to explore HTML, CSS & JavaScript in my own way by creating a framework I can improve over time and use in future web projects. 

With this, I'm learning in a modular way, taking elements of the web and spending time studying these parts so I can figure out my personal way of working.
